Ingredients:

6 free-range chicken thighs, skin on, bone in
sea salt
freshly ground black pepper
plain flour for dusting
olive oil
100g	iberico chorizo, sliced
6 slices higher-welfare pancetta or streaky bacon, chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 litres organic chicken stock, hot
2 large pinches	saffron
1 heaped teaspoon smoked paprika
500g paella rice
1small bunch flat-leaf parsley,leaves picked and chopped, stalks chopped
2 handfuls fresh or frozen peas
10 king prawns, from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger
500g mussels, from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger, scrubbed, optional
2 small	squid, from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger, halved and scored, optional


Method:

Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Season the chicken pieces and dust with flour. Heat a little olive oil in a large deep pan and fry the chicken until golden brown on both sides. Place the pieces on a baking tray and into the oven for 20 minutes.

Put the pan back on the heat. Add the sliced chorizo and pancetta or bacon and fry until browned and crispy. Then add the onion and garlic and cook until soft. Meanwhile infuse half the hot chicken stock with the saffron. Add the smoked paprika, rice and infused stock and leave to cook on a medium heat, stirring from time to time.

After 20 minutes the rice should be nearly cooked. At this point, pour in the rest of the stock along with the peas, prawns, and the mussels and squid if you are using them. Place a lid on the pan and cook for 10 minutes more.

Finally, add the cooked chicken and serve sprinkled with chopped parsley and a wedge of lemon.
